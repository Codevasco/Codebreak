## **Codebreak**

#### Description

A simple side-scroller catcher game made in a week as part of Academia de Código's bootcamp's Games Week. The game was made using Java, OOP concepts, and an in-house graphics library provided by Academia.

Known issue: the game sound will persist until the Java platform binary program is closed from the task manager (sorry!)

#### **How To Play**

Run the .jar file (should run on any system) and follow the instructions in the game.
